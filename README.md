## 1. Intro 📚
This is the first proyect that I do using two new technologies for me; HTML and CSS. HTML (Hypertext Markup Lenguaje) is the baisc component of the web and with CSS creates web pages that everyone use on a daily basis in a navigator. We defined the esctructure, style and content with this tecnologies. 

## 2. What I build 👷🏻‍♀️
The proyect is focused on the google's user interfaz with special attention to the user experience to replaicate its behavior and style. This proyect contains the following sections:

* Header: In this section we can find the main navigation of Google like the profile picture, icons and menu. 

* Main: In this section we find the container for the central and most important elements of the interfaz such as the logo, search bar, icons and bottons.

* Footer: It containst the extra Gogole information for the user to read as hiperlinks at the end of the page. 

## 3. Objetives of the proyect 🚀
The main objective was to learn to use and put in practice different HMTL and CSS elements using inspection to identify the components of a web page and replicate them.
